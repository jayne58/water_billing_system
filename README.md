# water_billing_system
The water billing system is a project I worked on as a final project required for completion of eMobilis Mobile Training Institute. The project consists of a front end website with details 
about Nairobi Water and Sewerage System and a system which allows new users to registers, existing users to log in and make payments, give feedback as well as check their ministatements.
The admin or staff can also login to the system and edit user details, update user details, delete a user and view feedback given by the users.
